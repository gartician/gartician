### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Garth and welcome to this unique corner of the internet! I consider myself a classically trained biologist who joined the ~dark side~ computational side of biology and I leverage my biological knowledge to guide my analyses. In my day-to-day position, I help life scientists understand the meaning of their sequencing data, and how that relates to their working hypotheses. In the Maxson Lab where I currently work, I provide bioinformatic support to all lab members and write pipelines to analyze new sequencing datasets. I am always interested in the latest bioinformatic tools and trends, and I enjoy working with biologists at all levels of the computational spectrum. 

When provided the chance, I develop/contribute to open-source bioinformatic software such as [GoPeaks](https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/gopeaks), [MultiQC](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC), and [HINT-ATAC](https://github.com/CostaLab/reg-gen). Get to know me more by visiting my [website](https://gartician.github.io/) and my [twitter](https://twitter.com/KongGarth)! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: profiling epigenetic changes in acute myeloid leukemia with the [Maxson](https://www.maxsonlab.org/) and [Braun](https://www.braunlab.org) Labs at the Oregon Health and Science University
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow), [docker](https://www.docker.com), and [package submission to conda forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html)
- 💬 Ask me about: bioinformatics, epigenetic analyses, oncology, informational interviews
